We will implement our mobile application via Android native Java language.




## External Requirements

In order to build this project you first have to install:

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

The user also needs any up-to-date device that supports the current version of Java.


## Setup

Go online and download Android Studio, this will let you run the app on an andriod emulator to see the practical version of the app.


## Running

* Make sure that Android Studio is installed on your computer
* Clone this repository
* Open Android studio and chose: "Open an existing Android Studio project"
* Chose correct project downloaded from this repository and open it
* When opened, choose the command "Run" to open an anroid emulator to see our app

# Deployment

When the application is considered to be in a releasable state, it will have to be exported. In order to export the app from Android Studio, you will need to go to the top section under "File". Next, you will need to select "Export to Zip". This will create a zipped folder holding all of the app's contents. You can then upload the app on whatever domain of your choice.

# Testing

To perform a J Unit tests, the user will need to select the java file containing the code they would like to test. Press CTRL SHIFT T at the same time, and a menu should appear. Select "Create New Test." Once you are in the create test dialog, edit the fields and select the methods you would like to use. Finally, choose generate.

## Testing Technology

For this application, the only testing technology required is Android Studio.
