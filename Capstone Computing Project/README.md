## Overview

#### Our vision for this project is to create an all-in-one fitness application. The user will be able to create an account when opening the app. The application will include an easy to use nutrition tracker for carbs, proteins, fats, as well as store information on your daily caloric intake. The user will enter in what they eat, and a nutrition chart will develop throughout the day to let the user know what they may need more or less of, or what they are doing well in. The user will also be able to enter in their weight, height, age, and what their fitness goal is as well as change these settings. Our app will then recommend daily workouts based on their specifed bodytype, fitness level, and desired goal to help ensure a committed healthy lifestyle with results. The platform in which we want our app to run on is Android devices. We will implement our mobile application via Android native Java language.




## External Requirements

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

The user also needs any up-to-date device that supports the current version of Java.


## Setup

Go online and download Android Studio, this will let you run the app on an andriod emulator to see the practical version of the app.


## Running

* Make sure that Android Studio is installed on your computer
* Clone this repository
* Open Android studio and chose: "Open an existing Android Studio project"
* Chose correct project folder downloaded from this repository (LIFTR) and open it
* When opened, choose the command "Run" to open an anroid emulator to see our app

# Deployment

When the application is considered to be in a releasable state, it will have to be exported. In order to export the app from Android Studio, you will need to go to the top section under "File". Next, you will need to select "Export to Zip". This will create a zipped folder holding all of the app's contents. You can then upload the app on whatever domain of your choice.
